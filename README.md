# Hidra Reminder Bot For Telegram

> Reminder bot, at first it was supposed to be a bot to remind you to drink water, but the idea evolved into a general reminder bot, where the user would enter the subject, for example doctor's appointment, day and time and the frequency he wants to be remembered, in addition to being able to delete a reminder.

### Adjustments and Improvements

The project is still under development and the next updates will focus on the following tasks:

- [ ] Remove reminder to drink water
- [ ] Create database to save the reminder
- [ ] Improve reminders so they can be personalized
- [ ] Add functionality to delete a reminder
- [ ] Edit a reminder feature
